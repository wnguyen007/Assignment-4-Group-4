\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Due to the effects of Covid-19, there has been a significant increase in demand for in-home entertainment. One particular form of this entertainment that continues to thrive due to streaming services such as Netflix and Stan is watching movies. This report will be analysing a large dataset from the popular reviews website, IMDb. It will attempt to answer questions such as what periods experienced a significantly higher quality of movies and which streaming services offer the greatest variety of movies.

According to IMDb, metascore is a single number that represents the overall critical opinion about a movie. Its legitimacy is derived from applying a weighted average to the reviews of the world's most respected critics. That said, metascore is still an extremely vague concept - particularly when it comes to the threshold of what metascore can be considered good.

\begin{table}

\caption{\label{tab:metascoretable}Metascore summary}
\centering
\begin{tabular}[t]{l|l}
\hline
  &   metascore\\
\hline
 & Min.   :  1.00\\
\hline
 & 1st Qu.: 43.00\\
\hline
 & Median : 56.00\\
\hline
 & Mean   : 55.76\\
\hline
 & 3rd Qu.: 69.00\\
\hline
 & Max.   :100.00\\
\hline
 & NA's   :68551\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Therefore, it is important to first consider the distribution of metascore within the data set. This is summarised by Table \ref{tab:metascoretable}. The most noteworthy features are that the median and mean are very close at 56 and 55.76 respectively and nearly 70,000 movies have not been assigned a metascore. Consequently, any analysis related to the metascore variable must be treated with caution as less than 20\% of the movies are represented.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{Report_files/figure-latex/metascorescatterplot-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:metascorescatterplot}metascore vs time}
\end{figure}

As expected, the scatter plot depicted in Figure \ref{fig:metascorescatterplot} is not particularly informative and potentially misleading. Although the spread is increasing, one can still identify a negative correlation which suggests that the quality of movies has degraded over time. However, it is important to recognise that this dataset was taken from IMDb which means that sampling was far from random. IMDb has much more incentive to review recently released movies. Hence, when older movies are reviewed, it is likely because it is still immensely popular (i.e.~a `classic').

\begin{table}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{Report_files/figure-latex/toptwentyhistogram-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:toptwentyhistogram}Time distribution of top twenty movies}
\end{figure}

The aforementioned `classics bias' is further confirmed by both Table \ref{tab:toptwentytable} and Figure \ref{fig:toptwentyhistogram}. This list is dominated by the most famous movies from the 1900's such as The Wizard of Oz, Citizen Kane and The Godfather which were all assigned perfect metascores. Moreover, seventeen of the twenty listed movies were released before 1975 and only one was released after 2000.

Assuming that metascore is a reliable representation of a movie's quality, it is easy to see why arguments have been made that movies produced in recent times are not as good. Contrarily, a counterargument can be made that there were just as many bad movies made during previous generations that have been forgotten or overshadowed by the classics. Due to the clear bias within this dataset, it is still unclear which argument is stronger.

The figure \ref{fig:language} shows the proportion of the number top 100 languages. It can clearly be seen that the English movies account for almost half of all movies. French, Spanish, Japanese, Italian almost have the same proportion with the number of above 2500. It is very clear to see the situation about the distribution.

It can be clearly seen that the largest number of movie languages is English, it has an increasing trend between 2009 and 2017 and will drop to 600 in 2019. The number of Korean language movies have the minimum quantity within the 9 languages, it shows a decreasing trend during the ten years.

The figure \ref{fig:genres} shows the proportion of top 100 movie genres, from the figure, we can see that the drama and comedy almost occupied 30\% of total movies, followed by the horror, comedy and romance, drama and romance, thriller.etc almost have the same proportion, this picture clearly shows the proportion of different movie genres.

\end{figure}

The figure \ref{fig:genresyear} graph shows the change in the number of different movie genres in ten years, from this figure, it can be seen that,the number of dramas and comedies almost exceeds 100 every year, and dramas almost reach 500 every year. When it comes to the line chart, the number of almost all movie genres peaked in 2017 and then fell to 2019. This is because the movie industry returns to the content ontology and enters the transition period from quantity to quality.

The table \ref{tab:ReviewTable} shows a sample of the review data used for the analysis. The main columns needed for Gross analysis are Title, User\_Reviews, and Critic\_Reviews.

Using the table contents, we plot data for a particular movie franchise. The franchises selected for this anlysis are Avengers and Spider-Man. We display plots to analyse how much the franchise spent for the movie and how much it grossed. Also a plot for the user reviews and critic reviews are displayed to see which were the most popular among all the movies in the franchise. We also plot the same for all the movies in the dataset.

\end{figure}

From the figure \ref{fig:AvengersGross}, it can be seen that all Avenger movies grossed more than the amount spent. Avengers: Age of Ultron grossed relatively lesser than the other movies. Endgame was the highest grossing Avenger movie.

\end{figure}

The figure \ref{fig:AvengersReview} displays how many reviews was given by users and critics. This can be a measure of how much the movies were talked about. The year tags show the timeline. It is evident that the first avenger movie in 2012 attracted the attention of critics with a high number of critic reviews. As time passed by, the movies become more popular among users which shows an increse in the fanbase till 2019. The only exception to this is a dip in user reviews for Age of Ultron which justifies why it grossed lesser than other movies.

{\centering \includegraphics{Report_files/figure-latex/SpiderManPlot-1}

\caption{Spider-Man Budget v/s Gross}\label{fig:SpiderManPlot}
\end{figure}

The figure \ref{fig:SpiderManPlot} shows the budget and gross of Spider-Man movies. Spider-Man grossed the highest and the sequels Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Man 3 grossed lesser showing a decline in the gross. The Amazing Spider-Man seems to have grossed better than its sequel The Amazing Spider-Man 2. These movies has grossed far less than the first 3 movies. The Homecoming and Far from Home movies seem to have made a great comeback in terms of its gross compared to the fourth and fifth movies. Far from Home has grossed more and spent less which makes it the second best Spider-Man movie after the first ever one in the franchise.

The figure \ref{fig:SpiderManReview} shows a graph for the number of reviews by critics and users over a period of time named by the years for each points. The first ever movie was most talked about by both fans and users in 2002. We see a dip in user reviews for 2004 and the movie in 2007 was a little better but the first ever was the best recieved. The fourth and fifth movies in 2012 and 2014 was talked about most by critics but never really kicked off among fans. This justifies its low grosses. The final sixth and seventh movies in 2017 and 2019 have made a great comeback after this dip and the latest one during 2019 has managed to almost equal the fanbase like it was when the franchise started.

The figure \ref{fig:AllReviewsPlot} looks shabby when you first look at it but it has some insights that can be drawn from it. The black cluster at the left bottom are the movies that have a low number of reviews by both users and critics. These are the least popular movies. The outliers are clearly visible in this plot with Endgame being the most popular among fans around the globe. This plot is used to pick the most popular movies to be used to compare the budget and gross. It is not necessary for a movie to be good, to be most talked about. So the next plot serves as a verification to confirm if the movie was talked about because it was good, or bad.

The figure \ref{fig:AllGrossPlot} shows the budget and gross of the most popular movies from over a century. We can compare the production cost, which is the budget, and the gross to ensure that it was most talked about because it was good. This plot also has information about the decade it was released in. This was to ensure there was no bias between the movies since currency value is always changing. The values are discrete and shows how much was spent and how much was grossed for that time. The gradient is gven to year using Viridis.

We get some interesting results from Table \ref{tab:dirtab}, as on one hand there is Mike Leigh with as much as 13 movies but a lower average Metascore. On the other hand, there are directors like Damien Chazelle and Patrick wang with 4 movies each and an average Metascore of 87 and 86 respectively.

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

\textbf{William's Section Conclusion}

There appears to be a strong correlation between movies that have been given extremely high ratings and the mid 1950's. However, due to the inherent bias within this data set, it is still impossible to identify which periods truly experienced a higher quality of movie production.

\textbf{Xue's Section Conclusion}

In conclusion, the English movie has the largest proportion of language movies within ten years, the drama movie is the favorite movie in all the country.

\textbf{Rahul's Section Conclusion}

In conclusion, we can see a general trend that a movie that is most talked about by the users or fans has grossed the most amount of money compared to lesser popular movies. The number of reviews by users can generally be used to predict if it was a box office hit.

\textbf{Aryan's Section Conclusion}

For Director analysis, it is clear from Figure 1 and Figure 2 that there is no one single way to measure success and that all directors in the list are doing very good in their own ways.

And from the Movie length analysis, we can infer that Hindi Movies are usually significantly longer than any other kind of movies. Also, english movies are among the shortest. We also concluded that movie language has an impact on movie length.
